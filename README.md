# QChat

QChat is a simple addon that primarily does 2 things. First of all, it allows your server to have a global chat and a local chat. The local chat radius is customisable, as is some other options. Second, it allows you to format how the text message looks in the global chat. The local chat is left like normal minecraft, like: "<playername> message". 

## Features:

- A global and a local chat for those times where it's necessary to not have every player on the serve hear what you talk about.
- A simple config file that's easy to configure.
- Supports permissions 3.x prefix and suffix retrieval.

## Requirements

- Bukkit #1000 or higher
